GzipStreamParsers
=================

This repository contains simple streaming parser for zipped ntriples created by the LOD Washing Machine.
This code is meant for illustrative purposes. We do not aim to be the most efficient ones (though we think our sub-format allows us to write one that is).

To run these examples:

* clone this repository
* `./run.sh`
